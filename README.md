# Project's Background
In response to the restrictions of using third-party libraries in a competition (LKS) even if it's a standardized and well-known library such as retrofit, and even live-data.
The competition's rules restricted the usage of other libraries besides the built-in and added in the initial project setup. Even last year judges explicitly said not to use retrofit

And I think it's stupid, so why don't we make the `retrofit` ourselves
